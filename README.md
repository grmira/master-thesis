# master-thesis

I've written my master thesis in partial fulfillment of the MSc Industrial Ecology of Leiden University and Delft University of Technology.
It researches Extended Producer Responsibility on plastic waste in Indonesia.
On this GitHub page the agent-based model can be found that I've made to analyze the plastic system while integrating EPR instruments.

Cheers!
